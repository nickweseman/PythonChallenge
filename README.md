# PythonChallenge
These are my answers to the Python Challenge by Nadav Samet.

Go to http://www.pythonchallenge.com/ to get started.

The first level (level 0) can be found at http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/0.html

After you solve a level, you can view the solution to that level and any previous levels by replacing "pc" with "pcc" in the URL:  e.g. http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pcc/def/0.html contains the level 0 solution.
